## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

All programs are written in standard C and can be compiled using the GCC compiler.

1.  **Navigate to the file:**
    ```bash
    cd <Your-Local-Path>/DSPrograms
    ```
2.  **Compile:** Replace `file_name.c` with the program you want to run (e.g., `BST.c`).
    ```bash
    gcc file_name.c -o output_name
    ```
3.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```
